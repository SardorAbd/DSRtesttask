This code is a test script written using Cypress to automate the registration form page. The purpose of this script is to verify that the page loads properly and that the registration form is rendering correctly.

The script begins by setting up the test environment using the beforeEach() function. It loads test data from a JSON file using the cy.fixture() command and visits the specified URL.

The main test case is defined within the it() function. It starts by setting the optimal viewport size to 1220x900 using the cy.viewport() command. Then, it interacts with various input fields on the form using the get() and type() commands. The test inputs values for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number fields.

Next, the script verifies the presence of radio buttons and selects the "Male" option using the get() and check() commands. It also interacts with a dropdown selection field, changing the vacancy type and verifying the selected value.

The script then selects a file using the selectFile() command for the "CV" field.

It checks the agreement checkbox, verifies that it is checked, and proceeds to click the submit button.

The script expects an alert message to be displayed and compares it to the expected result using the expect() statement.

Overall, this code performs a series of actions on the registration form page and checks that the expected behavior is met.
